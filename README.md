# ♻️ REMWaste Skip Selector Redesign

This project is part of a front-end code challenge for REMWaste. The objective is to **redesign the “Choose Your Skip Size” page** to look completely different from the original, while preserving its functionality and improving user experience.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Redesign the skip selection page at [`https://wewantwaste.co.uk`](https://wewantwaste.co.uk) after entering postcode `LE10 1SH`, selecting an address, and choosing “garden waste”.
- Display skip options fetched from a custom API.
- Ensure a clean, responsive design for both desktop and mobile users.
- Improve visual clarity, UX consistency, and code maintainability.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
